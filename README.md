# National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS) Data Analysis

## Description

This project focuses on analyzing data from the National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS) to identify trends and insights in outbreaks across the United States between 1998 and 2023. The analysis covers outbreak trends by year, the states most affected, common transmission modes, outbreak etiologies, and the severity of outbreaks in terms of hospitalizations and deaths.

## Dataset

The dataset includes detailed information on outbreaks, including:

- Timeframe: 1998-2023
- Outbreak location (by state)
- Transmission modes (e.g., foodborne, waterborne)
- Etiology (pathogen causing the outbreak) and serotypes
- Number of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths
- Associated food vehicles, water exposure, and animal types

## Analysis

Key areas of analysis include:

1. **Outbreak Trends by Year**: Analysis of the number of outbreaks each year from 1998 to 2023.
2. **Top 10 States with the Highest Number of Outbreaks**: Identifying which states have been most affected.
3. **Common Transmission Modes**: Exploring how outbreaks were transmitted (e.g., foodborne, waterborne).
4. **Outbreak Etiologies Over Time**: Understanding which pathogens were most responsible for outbreaks over time.
5. **Hospitalization vs. Death**: Comparing the severity of outbreaks in terms of hospitalizations and fatalities.
6. **Top Food Vehicles Involved**: Examining the food items most commonly associated with outbreaks.
7. **Top Animal Types Involved**: Identifying the types of animals linked to outbreaks.
